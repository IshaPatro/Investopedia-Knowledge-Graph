"Zero-Coupon Swap: What it is, How it Works","A zero-coupon swap involves the fixed side of the swap being paid in one lump sum when the contract reaches maturity./nThe variable side of the swap still makes regular payments, as they would in a plain vanilla swap./nBecause the fixed leg is paid as a lump sum, valuing a zero-coupon swap involves determining the present value of those cash flows using a zero-coupon bond's implied interest rate.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-coupon-swap.asp
