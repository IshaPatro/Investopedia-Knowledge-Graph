-by Isha Patro

Imagine a world where financial knowledge is seamlessly connected, making complex concepts easy to grasp. This paper presents an innovative approach to organizing financial information by building knowledge graphs from Investopedia's key takeaways. By capturing and connecting crucial insights, we transform fragmented information into a coherent network of financial wisdom.
We begin by scraping key takeaways from Investopedia, focusing on the most concise and essential points. These takeaways are then analyzed to identify and map connections between different financial concepts, creating a dynamic knowledge graph. This graph provides an intuitive way to navigate through financial information, uncovering hidden relationships and enhancing understanding. Our research details the technical steps involved in scraping, processing, and constructing the knowledge graph, addressing challenges in data extraction and analysis.
Through real-world examples, we demonstrate how our knowledge graph reveals connections, supports sophisticated queries, and provides a deeper understanding of financial topics. By organizing financial data into an interconnected network, users can explore how different concepts relate to each other, leading to new insights and a clearer understanding of complex topics. This study aims to revolutionize the way financial data is accessed and used, offering a new level of clarity and insight for anyone navigating the financial landscape.
