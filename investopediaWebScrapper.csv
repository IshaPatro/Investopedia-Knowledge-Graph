This could mark the end of the uptrend or a pullback from an upswing to a more significant downtrend., Ideally, both candles are of decent size relative to the price bars around them.

Stochastic RSI -StochRSI Definition,"A StochRSI reading above 0.8 is consideredoverbought, while a reading below 0.2 is consideredoversold. On the zero to 100 scale, above 80 is overbought, and below 20 is oversold., Overbought doesn't necessarily mean the price will reverse lower, just like oversold doesn't mean the price will reverse higher. Rather the overbought and oversold conditions simply alert traders that the RSI is near the extremes of its recent readings., A reading of zero means the RSI is at its lowest level in 14 periods (or whatever lookback period is chosen). A reading of 1 (or 100) means the RSI is at the highest level in the last 14 periods., Other StochRSI values show where the RSI is relative to a high or low.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochrsi.asp

"Zero-Bound Interest Rate: Meaning, History, Crisis Tactics","Conventional wisdom says that interest rates are ""zero-bound."" That is, forcing rates below zero will not stimulate economic activity., That's logical: Why would anyone pay to loan money?, In fact, rates were allowed to drift below zero in three recent crises., The policy may have worked, perhaps because investors sought safety.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-bound-interest-rate.asp
"Zero Capital Gains Rate: What It is, How It Works, Example","A zero capital gains rate incurs no taxation on the sales of assets or property that would otherwise have a capital gain., A 0% rate on the sale of property is most often associated with enterprise zones, which are special areas granted special status by a government in order to encourage development and economic growth., In order to keep a zero capital gains rate, property owners must meet certain qualifications and requirements, which may vary among different enterprise zones.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero_capital_gains.asp
